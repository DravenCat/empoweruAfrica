## Sprint 3 Planning Meeting: 
This meeting is held on July 4, 2021 on Discord. The main purpose of this meeting is to make a clear plan for Sprint 3 and break down tasks to subtasks. All of the team members attended the Sprint 3 Planning Meeting. In the meeting, we first determined what we will show for the Sprint 3 Demo. After that, we selected the user stories that we want to achieve by the end of Sprint 3, and broke them down into smaller tasks and assigned tasks to every team member. At last, we decided the dates of every standup.

## Spikes:
When building the learning page, we used javascript to interact with DOM to control the expansion of an element and this led to the undesired result when we write the element as an react component, because the javascript changes every element with the same class name. Instead we used state, because the state in react component is isolated, it works perfectly fine.
