## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint:
- Conduct standup meeting regularly to ensure the work pace
- Completing every document at the start of the sprint to ensure everyone knows the pacing of the sprint
- Distributing the work fairly
- Use more meaningful commit messages in Github
- Adding documentation to codebase
- Writing documentation outside of codebase to design and have a skeleton for our database and API endpoints
- Achieve agreement on interfaces before starting coding. 



## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint:
- Add the user story number in every commit
- Doing unit testing before integration testing 



## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint:
- Write code without thoroughly testing
- Didnâ€™t write some documentations when writing code


## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2:
- Writing documentations 
- Being unable to test all the code from frontend to backend due to slow integration
